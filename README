A recreational hobby project, recreating common Javascript libraries and tooling
without any dependencies.

To be able to do anything else I start by building a testrunner.
After that a code bundler (inspired by Webpack).

- unit: Testrunner
- bundle: Code Bundler
- act: Library for client side views
- dux: Library for state management
