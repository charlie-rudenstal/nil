A recreational hobby project, where I recreate common Javascript libraries and tooling
without using any dependencies.

- [x] unit: Testrunner
- [ ] bundle: Code Bundler
- [ ] act: Library for client side views
- [ ] dux: Library for state management

## Install

To create a symlink for the `unit` executable
```
  $ npm link
```

## Test

If you have run `npm link`
```
  $ npm test
  or
  $ unit
```

Alternatively you can call the unit tester directly
```
  $ node unit/unit.js
```
